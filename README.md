# SortEDU
Because the public education system hates my ass, I have to do sorting algorithms. Yay. C# &amp; VB.

## How to use?
I've really only got the base Module that's worth using. The two Program classes (cs/vb) are just personal tests.

If you want to use it, just call the `SortingAlgorithms` class with the appropriate sorting algorithm.

I'll implement a proper testing system soon.

## What does this aim to achieve?
I need to satisfy the ever-growing needs of the out-of-date Department of Education to ensure that I get a good curriculum and education. 
(pls don't judge)
